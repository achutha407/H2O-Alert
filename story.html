                <h2>Patqapara village’s pond restoration</h2>
                <p>Before: Patqapara, a remote village in West Bengal, grappled with severe water shortages. 
                    Its ponds had become wastelands, and agricultural output had dropped drastically.</p>
                <p>After: In partnership with NGOs, the villagers restored 15 neglected ponds by removing silt and deepening them.
                     These rejuvenated ponds now provide year-round water for farming and fishery activities, revitalising the local economy.</p>            </div>

                <h2>Badi Dani’s revival of the Bartasar Pond</h2>
                <p>Before: In Badi Dani, a drought-prone village in Rajasthan, the ancient Bartasar Pond had dried up. 
                    Water scarcity had caused crop failures and forced people to migrate in search of work.</p>
                <p>After: The local community came together to deslit and strengthen the pond’s embankments. 
                    This initiative helped recharge groundwater, secure irrigation needs, and restore the village’s natural ecosystem.</p>            </div>

                <h2>Surgana Taluka’s comprehensive water conservation</h2>
                <p>Before: In Nashik’s Surgana taluka, chronic drought left fields barren and villagers dependent on distant water sources.</p>
                <p>After: Supported by the Naam Foundation and NHPC Ltd, communities adopted techniques like trenching, bunding, and rainwater harvesting.
                     These efforts raised groundwater levels and boosted agricultural productivity, turning the villages into models of water management.</p>

                <h2>Rajendra Singh’s revival of Rajasthan’s rivers</h2>
                <p>Before: In the 1980s, Rajasthan’s Alwar district faced extreme drought. Rivers had dried up, wells were empty, and agriculture had come to a standstill. With livelihoods lost, many villagers migrated, leaving behind a parched and desolate land.</p>
<p>After: Rajendra Singh, affectionately known as the ‘Waterman of India’, led a movement to construct johads (traditional earthen dams).
     Working alongside local communities, he helped build over 8,600 johads across 1,200 villages, rejuvenating five rivers, including 
    the Arvari and Ruparel. His work revived groundwater levels, restored agriculture, and brought prosperity back to the region.</p>

                <h2>  Aabid Surti’s crusade against leaky taps</h2>

              
                <p>Before: In the busy suburbs of Mumbai, thousands of households ignored the quiet drip of 
                    leaking taps, leading to enormous water wastage each day.</p>
                <p>After: Aabid Surti, an octogenarian writer and artist, founded the Drop Dead Foundation. Every Sunday,
                     he personally visited homes and offered free tap repairs. Over 15 years, he fixed leaks in over 13,000 homes, saving millions of litres of water and raising vital awareness about everyday conservation. </p>            </div>
